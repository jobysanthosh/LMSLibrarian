#LMS Librarian
The objective of this application was to create a Library Management System using Springboot and Maven. This part of the project is the Admin user microservice that contains all the API's for the library users and all the methods for them to perform CRUD and override operations on the data stored in the database. I learned the concept of microservices as the two other members in my team wrote the Admin and Borrower microservices which we couples together through an Orchestrator. I also learned how to create a springboot application using Spring Initializr.
